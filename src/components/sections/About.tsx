              Hi! My name is Jonathan, and I enjoy creating things that live on
              the internet. My interest in web development began after
              completing the Harvard CS50:{' '}

              course. After that, I was hooked on all things programming.
              Eventually, I discovered{' '}

              and began my journey into web development.
            </p>
            <p>
              What followed was a year of intense self-learning, where I taught
              myself the fundamentals of web development and design. I initially
              started by building websites and applications with HTML, CSS, and
              JavaScript. Following that, I then learned React, Next.js,
              Tailwind CSS and TypeScript, which took my skills to the next
              level.

              I&apos;m currently looking for a full-time position as a Front-end
              Developer, where I can continue to grow and improve my skills.
